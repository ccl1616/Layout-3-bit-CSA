# Layout-3-bit CSA

This is my layout 3-bit CSA project, design transistor level schematic and layout an 3 bit CSA by cell-based design. Minimize the design area.
- Result: My design ranked pretty well, ranked **3% among 96** students in this class.
- Class information: NTHU, 11010CS312000
- Manufacturing technology: 180 nm process
- Layout tool: Virtuoso
- DRC, LVS tool: Calibre
- Design specification:
    - Design all the followings by cell-based design method. For metal layer, only metal1 and metal2 are allowed.
    1. Design a 2x1 multiplier, MUX21.
